🌤 Simple Weather App – Firebase Hosting Project
🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a Simple Weather Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — then host it on Firebase for free.
It fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays temperature, weather conditions, and city details.

This is a Day 4 project under the folder:

day4/
└── Firebase_Hosting/
    ├── index.html
    ├── style.css
    ├── script.js

🧠 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you’ll learn:

How to use Fetch API to call real-time weather data.

How to structure a clean frontend app with HTML, CSS, and JS.

How to configure and deploy a project using Firebase Hosting.

How to work with public APIs (OpenWeatherMap).

How to manage environment setup and deployment commands.

🚀 Step-by-Step Setup Guide
1️⃣ Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have these installed:

Node.js
 (LTS version recommended)

npm
 (comes with Node.js)

A Google account (required for Firebase)

Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

2️⃣ Create/Open the Project Folder

If you haven’t already, create your Firebase_Hosting folder or open it in VS Code:

cd path/to/day4/Firebase_Hosting


Make sure it contains:

index.html
style.css
script.js

3️⃣ Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key

Go to https://openweathermap.org/api

Sign up for a free account.

Go to your profile → My API Keys.

Copy the key and paste it in your script.js (or inside the <script> tag in your HTML):

var apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";

4️⃣ Install Firebase CLI

Open your terminal and install Firebase globally:

npm install -g firebase-tools

5️⃣ Login to Firebase
firebase login


This opens a Google sign-in window. Use your Gmail account.

6️⃣ Initialize Firebase Hosting

Inside your project folder:

firebase init


When prompted:

Choose Hosting: Select Hosting: Configure files for Firebase Hosting.

Select project: Choose an existing Firebase project or create a new one.

Public directory: Type Firebase_Hosting (or just . if your HTML is in root).

Single-page app: Type n.

Overwrite index.html: Type n (No).

This creates firebase.json and .firebase folders.

🚀 7️⃣ Prepare and Deploy to Firebase

After you’ve run firebase init, Firebase creates a new folder named public in your project directory.
This folder is where Firebase looks for the files it will host.

Follow these steps carefully 👇

Step 1️⃣ – Preview Locally

Before deploying, run this command to preview your site locally:

firebase serve


💡 This opens a local server (e.g., http://localhost:5000
) so you can check your project before publishing.

If everything works fine, continue to the next step.

Step 2️⃣ – Move Your Project Files

Firebase’s default public folder contains a sample index.html file.
You need to replace it with your actual project files.

Go to your project directory.

Open the public folder that Firebase created.

Delete the default index.html file inside it.

Copy your actual project files into public/, for example:

public/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js


Now Firebase will serve your weather app instead of the sample file.

Step 3️⃣ – Deploy to Firebase

Once your files are inside the public folder, run:

firebase deploy


Firebase will:

Upload your files

Build the hosting configuration

Provide a public URL for your app

You’ll see a success message like:

✔  Deploy complete!

Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project-id/overview
Hosting URL: https://your-app-name.web.app


Click the Hosting URL — your weather app is now live 🌤

💻 How It Works

User enters a city name.

The app calls the OpenWeatherMap API using fetch().

The API responds with weather data (JSON).

The temperature (converted to °C), city name, and condition are displayed.

Invalid city names trigger an alert message.

🧠 Concepts You’ll Learn

✅ Fetch API for REST calls
✅ JSON data handling
✅ Basic DOM Manipulation
✅ OpenWeatherMap API usage
✅ Firebase Hosting setup & deployment
✅ Real-world hosting workflow
