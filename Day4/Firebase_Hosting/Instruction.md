# 🌤 Simple Weather App – Firebase Hosting Project

## 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a **Simple Weather Web App** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then host it on **Firebase Hosting** for free.

It fetches live weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays temperature, weather conditions, and city details.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
* **npm** (comes with Node.js)
* **Google account** (required for Firebase)
* Basic understanding of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

---

### 2️⃣ Create/Open the Project Folder

```bash
cd path/to/day4/Firebase_Hosting
```

Make sure it contains:

```
index.html
style.css
script.js
```

---

### 3️⃣ Get an OpenWeatherMap API Key

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Go to **Profile → My API Keys**
4. Copy the key and add it to your script.js:

```javascript
var apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
```

---

### 4️⃣ Install Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

---

### 5️⃣ Login to Firebase

```bash
firebase login
```

This opens a Google sign-in window. Use your Gmail account.

---

### 6️⃣ Initialize Firebase Hosting

```bash
firebase init
```

When prompted:

* **Choose Hosting** → Configure files for Firebase Hosting
* **Select project** → Choose existing or create new
* **Public directory** → `Firebase_Hosting` (or `.` if HTML is in root)
* **Single-page app** → `n`
* **Overwrite index.html** → `n`

This creates `firebase.json` and `.firebase` folders.

---

### 7️⃣ Prepare and Deploy to Firebase

#### Step 1️⃣ – Preview Locally

```bash
firebase serve
```

* Opens a local server (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`)
* Check your app before publishing

---

#### Step 2️⃣ – Move Your Project Files

* Delete default `index.html` inside Firebase’s **public/** folder
* Copy your project files:

```
public/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── script.js
```

---

#### Step 3️⃣ – Deploy to Firebase

```bash
firebase deploy
```

Firebase will:

* Upload files
* Build hosting configuration
* Provide a **public URL**

Example success message:

```
✔  Deploy complete!
Project Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/your-project-id/overview
Hosting URL: https://your-app-name.web.app
```

Click the URL → your weather app is now live 🌤

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. User enters a city name
2. App calls the OpenWeatherMap API using `fetch()`
3. API responds with weather data (JSON)
4. Temperature (°C), city name, and condition are displayed
5. Invalid city names trigger an alert message
